# Learning Akka Streams & Http 2.4.x

## Task

How to read a web resource, and expose it as a stream of `String`s?

## Getting started

You'll need:
- `sbt`
- `npm`

We use `npm serve` to serve the `data/a.txt` file as `http://localhost/a.txt`:

```
$ npm install serve
$ node_modules/.bin/serve data
```

Then:

```
$ sbt test
```


## Background

The role of this repo is to serve as a sample to get the code running. Once it is, it can serve as a sample to others.
