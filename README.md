# Learning Akka Streams & Http 2.4.x

## Task

How to read a web resource, and expose it as a stream of `String`s?

## Background

Something like this is trivial with - say - Rx family of streaming.

With akka-streams, it's not.

One problem seems to be that HTTP part is in `akka-http`, streaming in `akka-stream`.

The role of this repo is to serve as a sample to get the code running. Once it is, it can serve as a sample to others.
